\title{Make and store a nearest neighbor index in the cell_data_set.}
\usage{
make_cds_nn_index(
  cds,
  reduction_method = c("UMAP", "PCA", "LSI", "Aligned", "tSNE"),
  nn_control = list(),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{a cell_data_set with the reduced dimension matrix from
which to make the nearest neighbor index and with which the index
is stored.}

\item{reduction_method}{a string giving the reduced dimension matrix
to use for making the nn_index nearest neighbor index.
Note: distances in tSNE space reflect spatial differences poorly
so using nearest neighbors with it may be meaningless.}

\item{nn_control}{a list of parameters to use for making the nearest
neighbor index. See the set_nn_control help for details.}

\item{verbose}{a boolean indicating whether to emit verbose output.}
}
\value{
a cell_data_set with the stored index.
}
\description{
Make a nearest neighbor index from the specified
reduction_method matrix in the cell_data_set using either the
default nearest neighbor method or the method specified in the
nn_control list parameter, and store the index in the
cell_data_set. This function returns a cell_data_set.
