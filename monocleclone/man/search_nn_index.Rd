\title{Search a nearest neighbor index.}
\usage{
search_nn_index(
  query_matrix,
  nn_index,
  k = 25,
  nn_control = list(),
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{query_matrix}{a reduced dimension matrix used to find the
nearest neighbors in the index nn_index.}

\item{nn_index}{a nearest_neighbor index.}

\item{k}{an integer for the number of nearest neighbors to return for
each cell. Default is 25.}

\item{nn_control}{a list of parameters used to search the nearest
neighbor index. See the set_nn_control help for details. Note: the
default annoy search_k parameter value is set to the default value
of 2 * n_trees * k. It does not know the value of n_trees that was
used to build the annoy index so if a non-default n_trees value
was used to build the index, you may need to set search_k in
nn_control list when you run search_nn_index.}

\item{verbose}{a boolean indicating whether to emit verbose output.}
}
\value{
a list list(nn.idx, nn.dists) where nn.idx is
a matrix of nearest neighbor indices and nn.dists is a matrix of
the distance between the index given by the row number and the index
given in nn.idx. If the same reduced dim matrix is used to make the
index and search the index, the index given by the row number should
be in the row, usually in the first column.
}
\description{
Search a nearest neighbor index for cells near
those in the query_matrix.
