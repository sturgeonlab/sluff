\title{Test genes for differential expression based on the low dimensional
embedding and the principal graph}
\usage{
graph_test(
  cds,
  neighbor_graph = c("knn", "principal_graph"),
  reduction_method = "UMAP",
  k = 25,
  method = c("Moran_I"),
  alternative = "greater",
  expression_family = "quasipoisson",
  cores = 1,
  verbose = FALSE,
  nn_control = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{a cell_data_set object upon which to perform this operation}

\item{neighbor_graph}{String indicating what neighbor graph to use.
"principal_graph" and "knn" are supported. Default is "knn", but
"principal_graph" is recommended for trajectory analysis.}

\item{reduction_method}{character, the method used to reduce dimension.
Currently only supported for "UMAP".}

\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors used for building the kNN graph which
is passed to knn2nb function during the Moran's I (Geary's C) test
procedure.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the method (currently only
'Moran_I' is supported) for detecting significant genes showing
correlation along the principal graph embedded in the low dimensional
space.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
must be one of greater (default), less or two.sided.}

\item{expression_family}{a character string specifying the expression family
function used for the test.}

\item{cores}{the number of cores to be used while testing each gene for
differential expression.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to show spatial test (Moran's I) errors and warnings.
Only valid for cores = 1.}

\item{nn_control}{An optional list of parameters used to make the nearest
neighbor index. See the set_nn_control help for detailed information.}
}
\value{
a data frame containing the p values and q-values from the Moran's I
test on the parallel arrays of models.

\description{
We are often interested in finding genes that are
differentially expressed across a single-cell trajectory. Monocle3
introduces a new approach for finding such genes that draws on a powerful
technique in spatial correlation analysis, the Moran’s I test. Moran’s I is
a measure of multi-directional and multi-dimensional spatial
autocorrelation. The statistic tells you whether cells at nearby positions
on a trajectory will have similar (or dissimilar) expression levels for the
gene being tested. Although both Pearson correlation and Moran’s I ranges
from -1 to 1, the interpretation of Moran’s I is slightly different: +1
means that nearby cells will have perfectly similar expression; 0 represents
no correlation, and -1 means that neighboring cells will be
\emph{anti-correlated}.
